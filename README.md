# Tool-Use-and-Conversational-Chess

This project demonstrates how to integrate tool use within conversational AI agents to play a game of chess. The agents use a chess library to manage the game state, make moves, and interact with each other in a turn-based manner. The setup also includes the addition of fun chitchat to enhance the engagement between the agents during the game. The following steps outline the process of setting up the agents, tools, and the chess game.
